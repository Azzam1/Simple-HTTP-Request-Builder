Hi everyony,


This is a very simple dynamic HTTP Request builder Objective-C class, where you can construct and built your "multi-part" HTTP requests.
Please, feel free to use/update it anytime anywhere :)

NOTE: you may want to change the constant SERVERURL to your desired Server/Remote URL.

Story:
One project I was working on, I needed to construct my own HTTP requests (with media files) and send them to the server, hence I tried to look at Cocoa libraries but could not find something ready-to-use.
So I sniffed at a regular HTML form that was submitting media files to the server, and tried to simulate it, and it worked for me :)
